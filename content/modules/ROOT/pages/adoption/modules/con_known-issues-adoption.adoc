Review the following known issues that might affect a successful adoption:

.Adoption of combined Controller/Networker nodes not verified

Red Hat has not verified a process for adoption of a {rhos_prev_long} ({OpenStackShort}) {rhos_prev_ver} environment where Controller and Networker roles are composed together on Controller nodes. If your {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} environment does use combined Controller/Networker roles on the Controller nodes, the documented adoption process will not produce the expected results.

Adoption of {OpenStackShort} {rhos_prev_ver} environments that use dedicated Networker nodes has been verified to work as documented.
