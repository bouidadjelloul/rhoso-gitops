= Stopping infrastructure management and Compute services

You must stop cloud Controller nodes, database nodes, and messaging nodes on the {rhos_prev_long} {rhos_prev_ver} control plane. Do not stop nodes that are running the Compute, Storage, or Networker roles on the control plane.

The following procedure applies to a single node standalone {OpenStackPreviousInstaller} deployment. You must remove conflicting repositories and packages from your Compute hosts, so that you can install libvirt packages when these hosts are adopted as data plane nodes, where modular libvirt daemons are no longer running in podman containers.

.Prerequisites

* Define the shell variables. Replace the following example values with values that apply to your environment:
+
[source,subs=+quotes,role=execute,subs=attributes]
